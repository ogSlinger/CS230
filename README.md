Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
        The Gaming Room is a game developer company that wished to deploy one of their multiplayer games, "Draw it or Lose it". They do not know
how to set up their system environment to support this game. Also, they requested a UML diagram of the design of the game service client.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
        I feel I broke down the logic flow of the program based off the supplied UML diagram. It was my first time translating a UML diagram to
explained object oriented logic as well. It was a definite helpful exercise.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
        The explaination of the domain model helped the most when developing the code. As stated above, being able to logically write out the
behaviour of the program allowed myself to better envision the code required to fufill the requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
        I feel the Development Requirements section needed most improvement. I would improve it by focusing on main points between each
cell block rather than hopping to different topics to weight out the pros and cons of each operating platform.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
        I feel I interpreted the user's needs through some of the recommendations in the design. I empathized with potential requirements based off
what the client may have that was not brought up in the original user story. I brought up things like what kind of traffic they may expect, the cost of
the server technologies required, and more. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing a product because not everything may be addressed
from within initial talks while in production.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
        I can utilize these processes to help with designing requirement documentation for future products I may work on. This helps broaden my tool set
when it comes to developing software. I wish to get into the VR/AR space and work on being a systems developer. I feel this would be considered a strong
skill to have in that space.
